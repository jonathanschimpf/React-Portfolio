    "description": "Data is stored in a .JSON file which has an array of objects that represent each image + caption. The data for each image + caption is dynamically generated to a single card component. After casually using Tumblr specifically to post my personal photographs and nothing else since 2010, I got to thinking recently: \"Why not make this a React App project?\".. So I exported all of my photo journal media and rebuilt it in a React setting. Writing Python scripts made extracting the captions possible. I used infinite scroll to avoid pagination when a user is traveling back in time. I have written logic for \"Header\" and \"Footer\" Navigation icons, to make it considerably easier and much more enjoyable for anyone navigating around an old photo blog.",

    "description": " \"Little Lemon | Authentic Mediterranean Cuisine in Chicago.\" This was the final project of the 9 course Meta / Coursera Front-End certificate program that I worked through from April - September, 2023. This project is for a faux restaraunt that you are to build a reservation form for. The form confirms if you've entered the basic criteria for making a reservation, and only then the reserve button becomes active. An API endpoint could be applied to send confirmation that the reservation request was received if this was actually a real establishment and not just a project for a Front-End Coursera program.",
